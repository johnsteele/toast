/**
 * An ImageChunk represents an image. An alignment of the image can be provided
 * (and is used as a hint by the renderer), along with an optional width and
 * height (to use the image's width and/or height, specify <code>-1</code> for
 * either or both of these values. 
 * <p>
 * The instance needs to know the {@link Slide} that it's part of so that it can
 * use the slide to gain access to the {@link SlideDeck} and get the
 * {@link SlideDeck#baseUrl} in order to form a complete {@link URL} for the
 * image. By using a URL format, we give ourselves a lot of flexibility in terms
 * of where the image can actually be stored. We can access images in the
 * Eclipse workspace, or configuration using a URL; we can also access remote
 * resources using an &quot;http://&quot;-prefixed URL. The best part is that
 * the mechanism for obtaining the resource is completely disconnected from all
 * of our code (and it's relatively easy to provide alternative URL protocols).
 * At display time, it is the renderer that takes responsibility for obtaining
 * the image and managing any resources associated with it.
